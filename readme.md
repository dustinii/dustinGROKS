# Grokking Algorithms in JavaScript

## About The Project

This repository is dedicated to working through the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. The primary goal is to understand and implement the various algorithms presented in the book using both pseudocode and JavaScript. This project is aimed at those who are interested in learning algorithms in a simple and intuitive way, as well as those looking to see practical implementations of these algorithms in JavaScript.

### Built With

- JavaScript
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Usage

Each chapter of the book is represented in its own directory, containing the pseudocode and JavaScript implementations of the algorithms discussed. You can use these implementations to understand how the algorithms work in a practical setting.

## Contributing

If you would like to add your own solutions or try building out the algorithms yourself, feel free to fork the project and create a feature branch!
